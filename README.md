## Features: 
- Auto-slide after 3 seconds if previous or next btn is not clicked.
- Throttle on clicking 'prev' or 'next' btn, as the slide animation takes 500 miliseconds, so if user clicks in that duration, that click is not taken into consideration. (**If user clicks multiple times in the span of 500 miliseconds on any btn, only 1 time click is considered**)

## Tech used: 
- CSS
- React
- TypeScript
